I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Information Science and Engineering from Mangalore, Karnataka, India which I completed in 2021. My primary education goal for this course is to deepen my understanding of data analytics and its applications in real-time scenarios, particularly within the context of financial sector. I have experience working in various computing environments, including Python, web development, SQL/DB2, R programming and C#. I am also familiar with COBOL,CICS and JCL for mainframe applications. Additionally, I have utilized python-based libraries and tools for statistical computing and data visualization.\nApart from my education, I find happiness in music, playing the guitar, dancing, creating mandala art, and spending time on platforms like Pinterest, Instagram, and LinkedIn. I love to learn and explore new things in my life, so I always say, Learning is a continuous processs, and I strive to maintain a balance between my personal and professional life."
